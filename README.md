# French sentiment analysis with BERT

> **How good is BERT ?** Comparing BERT to other SOTA approaches on a large-scale **French sentiment analysis** dataset :books:

The contribution of this repository is threefold.

- Firstly, I introduce a new dataset for sentiment analysis, scraped from [AllocinÃ©.fr](http://www.allocine.fr/) user reviews.
It contains 100k positive and 100k negative reviews divided into 3 balanced splits: train (160k reviews), val (20k) and test (20k).
At my knowledge, there is no dataset of this size in French language available on the internet.

- Secondly, I share my code for French sentiment analysis with BERT, based on [CamemBERT](https://camembert-model.fr/), and the [ðŸ¤—Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.

- Lastly, I compare BERT results with other SOTA approaches, such as *TF-IDF* and *fastText*, as well as other non-contextual word embeddings based methods.

| :warning: This repository is still a WIP, which means that the results are added as things progress. Because it's in active development, the dataset and the models are not yet fixed and may change. |
