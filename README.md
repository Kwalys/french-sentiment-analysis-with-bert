# French sentiment analysis with BERT
> **How good is BERT ?** Comparing BERT to other SOTA approaches on a **French sentiment analysis** dataset :books:

The contribution of this repository is threefold.

- Firstly, I introduce a new dataset for sentiment analysis, scraped from [Allociné.fr](http://www.allocine.fr/) user reviews.
At my knowledge, there is no dataset of this size in French available on the internet.

- Secondly, I share my code for French sentiment analysis with BERT, based on [CamemBERT](https://camembert-model.fr/).

- Lastly, I compare BERT results with other SOTA approaches, such as TF-IDF and fastText.
